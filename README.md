# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/a1frmthe8/Hacker-simulator/releases) uses [Babel](https://github.com/a1frmthe8/Hacker-simulator/releases) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/a1frmthe8/Hacker-simulator/releases) uses [SWC](https://github.com/a1frmthe8/Hacker-simulator/releases) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/a1frmthe8/Hacker-simulator/releases) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://github.com/a1frmthe8/Hacker-simulator/releases) in your project.
